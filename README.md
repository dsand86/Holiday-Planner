# Holiday-Planner
App that optimizes and balances holidays in oder to have maximum of free days

Main idea:
Based on one's working schedule, national holidays, and preferences for the holidays (minimum amount of days to be taken, time of the year, etc.) compute the most efficient way to take days-off (couple together holidays with weekends; calculate bridge days, etc.). The end result is a less stressed person, more time for themselves, and better time management.
Future features:
- country dependent
- culture-dependent (English, German, etc.)
- alarm for low-prices for flights/trains for specific destination, so that, for flexible persons, one could benefit the most of the travel offers (e.g., one is willing to spend holiday in Cuba between March - Mai, so best offers for this period are searched; or one wants to spend holiday in India, no matter the time of year, but within a budget; the alert should provide one's the solution)
- some more simulations/statistics

DONE:
